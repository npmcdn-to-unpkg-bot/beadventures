            <h2>Borneo Ethical Adventures (BEA) - the journey begins..</h2>
            <p>
                The story begins with a life changing journey into the remote part of Borneo. I was flown in for a job  interview to manage a world heritage national park. As soon as my feet touched the ground I knew that I had arrived at a very special place. One where the sense of community was so strong, that the harsh environment and ever changing river levels made them resilient to all that nature could throw at them. So pure a community that doors were never locked, voices were never raised and children shared, laughed and seldom cried.
            </p>
            <p> The national park was a healthy ecosystem where 3 million bats devoured 15 ton of insects every night, the jungle resonated with cicada, katydid, frogs, birds, the occasional monkey.
            </p>
            <p>I knew that no matter how hard it would be to leave my family and friends in Fremantle, Western Australia it was going to be a life changing experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the next two years I became accustom to the morning wake up call of the forest, the 6 o'clock sound of the cicada, the signs of rains, floods and seasonal changes. I worked along side the the Penan, Berawan communities, government departments, NGO's. I facilitated visits and tours for delegations, conferences, tourist and a steady stream of family and friends.
            </p>
            <img style="float:left; margin: 0px 20px 20px 0px;" src="/static/img/ali_contact.JPG"/>
            <p>My 50th birthday was a turning point when I devised a tour for 28 friends through Kuching and Mulu.

            </p>
            <p>We visited the most popular but also unknown places that I had discovered over the years. We contributed to small businesses and remote communities as we travelled. Meals were prepared for us by local communities, school P&C's, we bought paint and painted a building at the school, I choose the best guides and favourite destinations adding my personal stories and experience as we travelled.

            </p>
            <p>My friends agreed that it was a trip of a lifetime, one that was not available as a package from Australia or abroad. One they would like to repeat, travelling further afield, spending more time connecting and giving to the communities.

            </p>
            <p>For me it was an exiterating trip that shared all that I loved and supported the people and land that I grown so accustomed to.

            </p>
            <p>This was the seed that grew into Borneo Ethical Adventures.
            </p>

            <p>
                I invite you to experience my Borneo, to meet the local people, eat the local food, travel into the jungle and support the communities whilst at the same time enjoying a balance of quaint old asia, sighting and all things that make a holiday just that- a holiday.
            </p>
            <p>
                So join  me, get our hands dirty, get your hearts touched and leave feeling a sense of connection never before achieved on a 10 trip abroad.
